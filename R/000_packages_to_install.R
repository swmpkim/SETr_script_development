# Run one line at a time below, and when you get the 'success' message,
# move on to the next line.
# sucess looks something like this:
# package ‘here’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

# if you have any errors, try to run it in R, not RStudio. It will ask you to
# choose a CRAN mirror for the session; choose the one that is geographically
# closest to you.

# If it still doesn't work, copy and paste the whole chunk (including the code you ran) into an email and send it to Kim
