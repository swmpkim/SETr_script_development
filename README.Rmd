# Project Summary  

Can marsh vegetation communities keep pace with sea level rise? To address this critical coastal management issue, the NERRS established a Sentinel Site Application Module of the System-Wide Monitoring Program. A centerpiece is the use of Surface Elevation Tables (SETs) to precisely measure marsh surface elevation over time. Many reserves have been collecting these data for years, resulting in a need for both Reserve-specific and System-wide data processing and analyses. We will create standardized tools to quality-check SET data, perform trend analyses, and produce informative visualizations for varied audiences. A technical team, to include a statistician, will focus on creating quality-control (QC) and analysis tools, while an outreach team will craft visualizations for communication products and educational curricula. In-person and webinar workshops will be held to train end-users on both technical and outreach tools. Participating Reserves will receive site-specific trend analyses, visualizations, and a national synthesis of surface elevation change vs. sea level trends. This project will catalyze the use of Sentinel Site data by providing Reserves the tools they need to analyze, understand, and communicate these important, underutilized datasets.
